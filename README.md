# SG Dial Sim (SGDS)

**IMPORTANT: This project is in an early stage of development. Functionality is very limited, and there may be a lot of bugs.**

SGDS aims to be a realistic recreation of the dialing computer depicted in the television show _Stargate SG-1_.

## How to Run

### Users

The latest release of SGDS is available for Windows and Mac on the [Releases page](https://github.com/PhilipF5/sg-dial-sim/releases).

### Developers

You can download and build the source code to run in your browser or compile as an app. You'll need Node.js and some familiarity with the command line. Simply clone this repo into a directory of your choice, and run your preferred Node package managers `install` and `start` commands. Note that app-specific or platform-specific functionality may be disabled when running in the browser.

## Technical

Most of the classic simulators from Stargate's internet heyday in the 2000s were built in Flash, much like many of that era's interactive websites. But as the web has moved on, so too can the simulator. SGDS is built using [Angular](https://angular.io), [GreenSock](https://greensock.com), and [Electron](https://electronjs.org). This means that the sim's visuals are written in HTML and CSS, and the logic and animations are written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript.
